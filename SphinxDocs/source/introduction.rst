Introduction
=============

This documentation revolves around a technology investigation into the Java implementation of the Google App Engine (GAE). The purpose of this documentation is to help other developers get started using GAE quickly so that they can focus on creating their apps. As the name suggests, much of the programming in this documentation is implemented using the Scala programming language. As such, the detailed instructions presented throughout will be geared specifically towards using Scala with GAE; with the exception of the views, which are written using JSPs.
	
Another important note is that I am using OS X Mountain Lion. For this reason, some of the instructions will be geared specifically towards Macs, but I will always try to link to some generic downloads, etc. for others.
